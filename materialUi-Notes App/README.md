#This app was built as a practice project to understand material Ui.

This app is built using react only. Fake API calls are created using json-server.

To run:

 a. Download the code & run **npm install** to install dependencies before starting the app.

 b. You'll also need to install Material UI as a dependency. To do this run **npm install @material-ui/core**
 
 c. **npm start run** and **json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000** to start the app
